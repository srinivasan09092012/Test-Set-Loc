# Guiding Principles

Back to [Project](../README.md) | [Architecture](README.md)

---

The guiding principles are the team's belief and value system which guides all decisions throughout the project life cycle in all circumstances, irrespective of changes in its goals, strategies or type of work. They build a foundation for culture where everyone understands what's important.

Our guiding principles will be supported by **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**. ADRs outline the latest position in support for the principle. ADRs can change over time, but our principles do not.

Global guiding principles are defined in the [ETS Reference Architecture](https://github.com/mygainwell/ets-architecture/blob/main/guiding-principles.md) repository. You are free to add project specific principles here, but they must not conflict with the global principles. If you feel a global principle needs to be added or amended, `Create a Pull Request` or reach out to the [Enterprise Technology Strategy](mailto:EnterpriseTechnologyStrategy@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com?subject=Guiding%20Principle%20Request) team and attach the principle.
