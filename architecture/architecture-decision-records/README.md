# Architecture Decision Records - ADRs

Back to [Project](../../README.md) | [Architecture](../README.md)

---

Use this section of the architecture repository to document your project level decisions. Remember, all ADRs defined in the Gainwell reference architecture apply to all projects. Only document decisions that are in addition to the reference architecture.

If you feel a decision should be at the reference level, you can `create a pull request` or reach out to the [Enterprise Technology Strategy](mailto:EnterpriseTechnologyStrategy@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com?subject=Reference%20ADR%20Request) team and attach the ADR.
