# Component Lists

Use this section of the architecture repository to document your project level components. Remember, all components defined in the Gainwell reference architecture apply to all projects. Only document components that are in addition to the reference architecture.

If you feel a component should be at the reference level, you can `create a pull request` or reach out to the [Enterprise Technology Strategy](mailto:EnterpriseTechnologyStrategy@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com?subject=Reference%20Component%20Request) team and attach the component.
