Use this section of the architecture repository to document your project level diagrams. Remember, all diagrams defined in the Gainwell reference architecture apply to all projects. Only document diagrams that are in addition to the reference architecture.

If you feel a diagram should be at the reference level, you can `create a pull request` or reach out to the [Enterprise Technology Strategy](mailto:EnterpriseTechnologyStrategy@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com?subject=Reference%20Diagram%20Request) team and attach the diagram.
