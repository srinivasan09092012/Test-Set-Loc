Use this section of the architecture repository to document your project level process patterns. Remember, all patterns defined in the Gainwell reference architecture apply to all projects. Only document patterns that are in addition to the reference architecture.

If you feel a pattern should be at the reference level, you can `create a pull request` or reach out to the [Enterprise Technology Strategy](mailto:EnterpriseTechnologyStrategy@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com?subject=Reference%20Process%20Pattern%20Request) team and attach the pattern.
