# Definitions of Done - DOD

Back to [Project](../README.md)

---

Use this section of the repository to document your project level definitions of done. Remember, all DODs defined in the Gainwell reference architecture apply to all projects. Only document definitions that are in addition to the reference architecture.

If you feel a definition should be at the reference level, you can `create a pull request` or reach out to the [Enterprise Technology Strategy](mailto:EnterpriseTechnologyStrategy@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com?subject=Reference%20DOD%20Request) team and attach the DOD.
