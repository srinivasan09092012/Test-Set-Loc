## Intro / Background / Context / Uses

This is a sample database, [AdventureWorks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms), provided by Microsoft to use for various training and testing purposes.

We are using it here for the following:
1. Provide a concrete example to use as reference
2. How reverse generation of database object scripts can work
3. How to incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) for database changes
4. Provide various scenarios of database change and its associated CI/CD impacts
