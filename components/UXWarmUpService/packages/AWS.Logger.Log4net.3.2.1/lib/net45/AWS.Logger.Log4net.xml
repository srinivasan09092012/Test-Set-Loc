        <member name="P:AWS.Logger.Log4net.AWSAppender.ProfilesLocation">
            <summary>
            Gets and sets the ProfilesLocation property. If this is not set the default profile store is used by the AWS SDK for .NET 
            to look up credentials. This is most commonly used when you are running an application of on-priemse under a service account.

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the Region property. This is the AWS Region that will be used for CloudWatch Logs. If this is not
            the AWS SDK for .NET will use its fall back logic to try and determine the region through environment variables and EC2 instance metadata.
            If the Region is not set and no region is found by the SDK's fall back logic then an exception will be thrown.

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the BatchPushInterval property. For performance the log messages are sent to AWS in batch sizes. BatchPushInterval 
            dictates the frequency of when batches are sent. If either BatchPushInterval or BatchSizeInBytes are exceeded the batch will be sent.
            <para>
            The default is 3 seconds.

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the BatchSizeInBytes property. For performance the log messages are sent to AWS in batch sizes. BatchSizeInBytes 
            dictates the total size of the batch in bytes when batches are sent. If either BatchPushInterval or BatchSizeInBytes are exceeded the batch will be sent.
            <para>
            The default is 100 Kilobytes.

            <para>
            The default is 10000.

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the LogStreamNameSuffix property. The LogStreamName consists of an optional user-defined prefix segment, then a DateTimeStamp as the
            system-defined prefix segment, and a user defined suffix value that can be set using the LogStreamNameSuffix property defined here.
            <para>
            The default is going to a Guid.

            <para>
            The default will use an empty string for this user-defined portion, meaning the log stream name will start with the system-defined portion of the prefix (yyyy/MM/dd ... )
