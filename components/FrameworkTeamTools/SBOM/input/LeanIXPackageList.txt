log4net 2.0.12|An application logger abstraction to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets (i.e. appenders). In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial. Full product documentation and configuration can be found at the following Log4Net supports the following logging levels: Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, All.  The product has been configured by default to use the log level and appenders shown in Table 5.  EventLogAppender Logs only Error messages to the configured windows application event log. Each component will log to a unique application name.  RollingFileAppender Logs all messages to the file system. The files are typically located under the executing component installation folder, but can be configured to log anywhere on the network file system given security permissions have been properly configured. These files roll based on size and keep a specified number of files.|21fc41de-7df9-414f-851b-ed70792abb2b
