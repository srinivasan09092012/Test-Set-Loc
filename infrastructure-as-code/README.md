# Infrastructure-as-Code - IAC

Back to [Project](../README.md)

---

Use this section of the repository to organize your project-level [infrastructure-as-code](https://github.com/mygainwell/ets-architecture/blob/main/dictionary.md#infrastructure-as-code---iac) artifacts. This repository should include artifacts to fully deploy your infrastructure and application components within [Platform Gainwell](https://github.com/mygainwell/ets-architecture/blob/main/dictionary.md#platfor-gainwell).

**Be sure and coordinate with the `Platform Engineering Team` to understand what environment resources are established at the platform-level**. Your project will leverage these global infrastructure resources and should not redefine them locally. If you think a resources should be handled at the platform-level, you can `create a pull request` or contact the `Platform Engineering Team` directly.

TODO: Choose an IAC framework below or add a new one. Then reorganize this section just to include your chosen strategy.
